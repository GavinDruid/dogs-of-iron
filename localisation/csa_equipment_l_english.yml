 CSA_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Richmond Rifle 1901 / Calhoun Bayonet"
 CSA_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "RR.01 / Calhoun"
 CSA_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The RR.01 is the general term given to around 12 variants of a single rifle design built for the Confederate Expeditiary Force in the Great War.  At its barest, the RR.01 was a breech-loading, bolt-action rifle in the vein of the SMLE variants of the Lee-Enfield rifles.  It weighed about 3.8 kilograms, and was considered fairly reliable, if lightweight and slightly less powerful than other Entente rifles.  The rifle varied considerably aesthetically, due to the fact many states produced the gun with widely different final designs.   A favorite among collectors of the period were rifles made with the Magnolia wood stocks of Georgia and Florida."
 CSA_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Richmond Rifle 1925A1 / MKII Grenade"
 CSA_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "RR.25A1 / MK II"
 CSA_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The RR.25A1 was the first post-war rifle developed for the Confederate army.  Chambering 8 rounds in a combined clip, and slightly longer in the barrel, it was designed as a specialty rifle for sharpshooters and special branch operations, but was generally adopted by the Army.  The MKII 'pinapple' grenade, meanwhile, was an American designed explosive weapon used for squad-level infiltration and trench-operations.  The Confederates had plenty a reason to adopt it."
 CSA_infantry_equipment_2:0 "M38A2 Thompson Variant 'Dixie'"
 CSA_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "M38A2 'Dixie'"
 CSA_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "Short on personal semi-automatic weapons, the War Department paid for a patent of the Thompson Submachine Gun from the United States.  This variant is lighter than the original - it used less steel, and overall less resources, which fit like a glove for the limited productive capacity of the CSA."
 CSA_infantry_equipment_3:0 "CSAC Service Rifle 42A2 / AT6 'Cobb' Recoiless Anti-Tank Rifle"
 CSA_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "CSAC SR.42A2 / AT6 'Cobb'"
 CSA_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The SR42A2 is the first mass-produced assault rifle of the Confederate Army.  Though, the term assault rifle is loosely used - the weapon had more in common with early designs of the StG '44 than battle rifles produced by the USA and Great Britain.  Still, it was impressive, and notably reliable, capable of working even submerged due to its largely sealed internals.  The Cobb, meanwhile, is a portable anti-tank rifle, issued to the head of every infantry company.  It was designed to puncture armor plating up to 2.2 inches thick, but was rarely used in frontal attacks.  Its light weight and modular design made it a blessing for infantry squads fighting armored ambushes."
 CSA_motorized_equipment_1:0 "CSAC General Motors 2 1/2 Import"
 CSA_motorized_equipment_1_short:0 "CSAC 2 1/2 Ton"
 CSA_motorized_equipment_1_desc:0 "The GMC 2 1/2 ton is a cargo truck built under license for the CSAC, or Confederate States Army Corporation.  Lacking significant auto industry of its own, the CSA bought the 2 1/2 tons to attempt to motorize their army before the onset of war with a foreign power.  Over a hundred thousand trucks were produced before the end of the era, most of which served in foreign theaters."
 CSA_mechanized_equipment_1:0 "CSAC M2 Halftrack"
 CSA_mechanized_equipment_1_short:0 "CSAC M2"
 CSA_mechanized_equipment_1_desc:0 "Bought in '41 under license from the British government, the M2 halftrack was the first mass-produced mechanized vehicle made for the Confederate Army.  These units are based on the Citroyen halftrack design seen in France before the outbreak of the war.  While only produced in small batches before the next design eclipsed it, this halftrack had a modest, but fair design in terms of armor and engine reliability."
 CSA_mechanized_equipment_2:0 "CSAC M5 Halftrack"
 CSA_mechanized_equipment_2_short:0 "CSAC M5"
 CSA_mechanized_equipment_2_desc:0 "The evolution of the licensed Halftracks bought from the USA.  Sporting better side and front armor, better transmission and overall better performance and reliability, the M5 provided the basis for a more functional mechanized infantry corps for the CSA."
 CSA_mechanized_equipment_3:0 "CSAC T8/T10 Halftrack"
 CSA_mechanized_equipment_3_short:0 "CSAC T8/T10"
 CSA_mechanized_equipment_3_desc:0 "The first wholly native halftrack design, the Transport T8 and T10.  Both take design inspiration from the M5.  An overall stronger design, built for extensive overseas operations and long-term deployment."
 CSA_anti_air_equipment_1:0 "Dallas 20mm Portable Anti-Air Gun"
 CSA_anti_air_equipment_1_short:0 "Dal. 20mm"
 CSA_anti_air_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Dallas 20mm is an anti-air weapon copied off low caliber Anglo-German variants of the first Great War anti-air gun.  Its heritage can be traced through the 'pom-pom,' a 37mm descendant that was fielded in the BEF to moderate success against balloons and biplanes.  It was designed to be used at a squad level, with a carriage for motorized transport." 
 CSA_anti_air_equipment_2:0 "Dallas 40mm Field Anti-Air Gun"
 CSA_anti_air_equipment_2_short:0 "Dal. 40mm"
 CSA_anti_air_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Dallas 40mm was the War Department's answer to heavier and faster aircraft.  When the 20mm alone proved unable to damage tougher targets, the CSAC used French, British and Soviet examples to fashion a heavier caliber weapon with applications on a mobile battlefield.  It was designed to be used at the company level."
 CSA_anti_air_equipment_3:0 "Dallas 75mm 'General Ripper' Field Anti-Air Gun"
 CSA_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "Dal. 75mm 'Gen. Ripper'"
 CSA_anti_air_equipment_3_desc:0 "The General was originally designed in '41, after studying intact copies of the Pak 36 75mm AA gun supplied by British Intelligence.  The Dal. 75 takes all of the positive qualities of the Pak 36 and makes them only slightly better - giving CSAC troops division-level support against air and hard ground targets."
 CSA_anti_tank_equipment_1:0 "Dallas 37mm Anti-Tank Artillery"
 CSA_anti_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Dal. 37mm AT"
 CSA_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Designed at the same time as German and US 37mm variants, the Dallas 37mm breaks Anglo-French calber scaling to provide strong, squad-level AT guns for defensive emplacements.  It was primarily effective against pre-war and early war light tanks and tankettes."
 CSA_anti_tank_equipment_2:0 "Dallas 47mm Anti-Tank Artillery"
 CSA_anti_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Dal. 47mm"
 CSA_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Upscaled from the 37mm and chambered to fit heavier shells, the 47mm copies off pre-war French AT weaponry.  Designed for heavy tanks and punching through heavily armored emplacements, it was more effective than the 37mm.  But only in certain qualities - after encountering the sloped armor of next generation tanks in France, it was painfully evident that not enough firepower was available to fight dedicated spearheads."
 CSA_anti_tank_equipment_3:0 "Dallas 88mm 'Eighty-eight' Anti-tank Artillery"
 CSA_anti_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Dal. 88mm"
 CSA_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The largest gun in the AT inventory of the Confederate Army was only just introduced in '43.  In order to deal with German and Soviet tanks, the CSAC commissioned the 88mm design, originally built for conventional artillery support, to be modified to be carried by carriage and to chamber AT rounds.  The result was an impressive, if bulky, hard counter to medium tanks of its day."
 CSA_artillery_equipment_1:0 "105mm Field Artillery"
 CSA_artillery_equipment_1_short:0 "105mm"
 CSA_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Confederacy's primary artillery weapons are mechanically derived from the Schneider 105mm, introduced in the late 1890s.  As the CSA intervened on the Entente's side, miltiary planners took note of the 105mm's role on the battlefield and made copies, gradually replacing their stock of 75mm pre-war guns."
 CSA_artillery_equipment_2:0 "120mm Field Artillery"
 CSA_artillery_equipment_2_short:0 "120mm"
 CSA_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "While limited within artillery brigades prior, war needs dictated that more heavier guns had to enter service to provide appropriate indirect fire.  The dedicated 120mm is the result - a stopgap between howitzers and medium field guns.  Heavier artillery variants like this one were ordered later, and thus carried fewer of the regional flare as their younger cousins.  They also didn't appear earlier because Confederate industry couldn't build enough of them to finance a large-scale war effort."
 CSA_artillery_equipment_3:0 "155mm Field Howitzer"
 CSA_artillery_equipment_3_short:0 "155mm"
 CSA_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "The heaviest conventional gun battery able to be carried efficiently on a Confederate battlefield.  Taking after some design elements of the US army's heavier Long Tom, the 155mm provides extremely heavy support from long ranges.  By the time of WW2, the Confederate Army could support entire columns of artillery on battlelines, which made creeping barrages and massed fire both achievable and reliable."
 CSA_gw_tank_equipment:0 "Renault FT-17 Light Tank"
 CSA_gw_tank_equipment_short:0 "FT-17"
 CSA_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "The FT-17 was the first legitimate light tank to be used in large quantities.  Introduced in 1918, the tank was given to American and Confederate divisions, as well as British and French, to pursue an advance into the low countries.  Post-war, the Confederacy bought and utilized FT-17s to maintain its armored battalions, seeing action in Cuba, Haiti and armed police actions in Central America."
 CSA_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Vickers-Armstrong Six-Ton"
 CSA_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Vickers Six-Ton"
 CSA_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Replacing the FT-17 was the Vickers Six-Ton, a model bought from the British between 1922 and 1930.  About 700 of them were bought before the War Department looked into native tank models.  By all accounts, the Confederate army considered them to be crappy vehicles.  While perfectly able to fight against small arms, the Vickers legitimately had a weak engine and numerous mechanical faults."
 CSA_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "CSAC A2 Creek"
 CSA_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "A2 Creek"
 CSA_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Creek, following the Vickers and patterning itself after the AMR 36, is both a better armored and better armed vehicle.  Sporting 45mm thick armor on the cupola and 50mm on the front, as well as a 37mm short-barrel cannon, it was ideally suited as an infantry support weapon.  However, it was just as slow as the Vickers, and handled poorly cross-country.  Still, it was mass-produced, and eventually eclipsed the Vickers in quantity."
 CSA_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "CSAC A4 Cherokee"
 CSA_light_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "A4 Cherokee"
 CSA_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Continuing the tradition of Indian naming schemes, the Cherokee was an odd duck on the modern battlefield.  After the success of the Bragg and the Beauregard, as well as the ringing victory of spearhead vehicles in the Battle of France, the demand for a light cavalry tank suddenly vanished.  This happened as the Cherokee was undergoing trials, and ultimately meant that it was underevaluated in favor of upgrading the Bragg.  The vehicle itself is respectable - much faster than the Creek and equally armed, while also equipped with a drive train that enabled excellent off-road handling."
 CSA_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "CSAC A5 Bragg"
 CSA_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "A5 Bragg"
 CSA_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Rather than follow the British and French into the cavalry/infantry dichotomy, the War Department experimented with a spearhead design in 1937.  Codednamed the Bragg, the vehicle was a tough little nut.  55mm armor, 55mm cannon, 295hp engine, in a slim profile that made it difficult to hit when approaching from the front.  Its only true weakness lay in its weaponry - while stronger than its light tank brothers, it needed artillery support to truly be effective as a breakthrough weapon."
 CSA_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "CSAC A5mkIV Bragg"
 CSA_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "MkIV Bragg"
 CSA_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Bragg was more than just successful as a medium tank.  Its presence was magnanimous, an image of the Confederate war effort.  It was an effective propaganda weapon, and army chiefs were reluctant to throw it out, despite its aging chassis.  So, in an effort to keep spirit up [and avoid high production costs], production lines changed only the front chassis and cannon profile, to combat the arrival of sloped armor.  The boost up to a 75mm long-barrel alone made it capable of trading with heavier tanks likethe Panzer IV and the Soviet T-34."
 CSA_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2:0 "CSAC A5R4 Ambush"
 CSA_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "A Bragg variant built to fight tanks with 75mm gun chambered for anti-tank rounds.  To save on cost, the cupola was removed and the barrel tied down to the chassis."
 CSA_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_short:0 "A5R4 Ambush"
 CSA_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_2:0 "CSAC A5R2 Bull"
 CSA_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_2_short:0 "A5R2 Bull"
 CSA_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Bull is another Bragg variant, designed in the same vein as the Ambush.  In tandem with motorized rocket artillery, the Bull became iconic in the Confederate army, a symbol of swift, brutal retribution."
 CSA_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "CSAC A6 Shiloh"
 CSA_medium_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "A6 Shiloh"
 CSA_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Production lines finally switched to a new model by 1943, as the Bragg's design finally became so old that it couldn't compete with designs like the T-34.  Its replacement, the Shiloh, was a study bastard.  Heavily armored, armed with a 75mm high-velocity cannon and multiple machine guns, and possessing a new Berliner-Joyce engine, it was all things but reliable.  While it could duel Panthers and Pershings on a good day, it suffered several mechanical faults.  It was impressive, but maintenance crews hated working with it."
 CSA_modern_tank_equipment_1:0 "CSAC H6 MacArthur"
 CSA_modern_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "H6 MacArthur"
 CSA_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The MacArthur was originally designed as a smaller heavy tank, competing with the Pershing in terms of artillery and horsepower.  Eventually, after the failure of the Shiloh, the War Department set about simplifying the tank variants down to one infantry tank and a handful of support vehicles.  The MacArthur embraced a lot of the tank philosophy of WW2 in its final design - it is, for all intents and purposes, bog standard in terms of mechanical and functional design."
 CSA_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "CSAC H1 Beauregarde"
 CSA_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "CSAC H1 Beauregarde"
 CSA_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The H1, the first native heavy tank of the Confederacy, had a lot in common with the Char B1.  Multiple turrets and 60mm+ armor plates made it powerful, though it wasn't put to mass production until 1937 due to its high cost.  It served as a frightening brick wall on the Arlington line, but as a breakthrough tank, its intended role, it was pathetically slow and prone to failure."
 CSA_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "CSAC H2 Hood"
 CSA_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "H2 Hood"
 CSA_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The H2, the Hood, was the Confederacy's first dedicated heavy tank.  Designers abandoned multiple cupolas for a broad drive train and a single turret, supported by the heaviest engine built for vehicles that weren't rolling stock, the Havoc 1937 diesel.  Though it was smaller and less heavily armored than the H1, welded slope armor provided much more effective countermeasures to other tanks of the day.  As an infantry tank, it was an infamous presence, as most medium tanks of its age couldn't even scratch its paint."
 CSA_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "CSAC H4 Longstreet"
 CSA_heavy_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "H4 Longstreet"
 CSA_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Longstreet continued the tradition of downsizing heavy tanks when the problem of off-road performance made the Hood unreliable outside of heavily industrialized areas.  Its successor, built off another entirely different chassis, had more in common with the Shiloh, save for its mechanical problems.  Roughly the same size gun, only a slightly heavier center, but with much tougher treads and a second iteration of the engine.  However, it drank oil by the gallon, and was difficult to build due to peculiar design decisions regarding its cabin wiring."
 CSA_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "CSAC Model 44 Revenge"
 CSA_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Model 44 Revenge"
 CSA_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "A massive tank model, appearing only in far-flung scenarios when the Confederacy loses the war.  Designed in a factory complex in the heart of Atlanta, the Revenge was a terrifying waste of resources.  So big it broke railroad track, armed with a 125mm gun, armored nearly 5 inches in places, it was a desperate attempt to fight back invaders that ultimately failed.  Only 3 were ever made."

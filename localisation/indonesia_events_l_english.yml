indonesia.106.desc:0 "The Netherlands East Indies lies at a crossroads, though sheltered from the great war, the colonial administration has not escaped the growing movements for native independence. Fueled by the rising power of Japan and the growing modernisation of the colony, native figures have arisen championing Independence under many banners. From the East, the fascist pro-Japanese champion the Right of Nationhood, the workers demand greater control over the fruits of their labour, and even the most sympathetic politicans are demanding a true democratic government. Whether the overburdened and undersupported colonial government will be able to quell these demands, or fall under wave of Independence, only time will tell."

 CSA_battleship_1:0 "Virginia Class"
 CSA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Virginia-class was the CSN's first superdreadnought design, first laid down in 1909.  Four were ready by 1914, and almost twelve were in operation by 1922.  They were designed to challenge the Union's Monroe doctrine by building a battleship that not only displaced more weight but carried overall heavier weapons.  Neither aim was reached due to production difficulties.  By 1936 it was severely obsolete."
 CSA_battleship_2:0 "John C. Calhoun Class"
 CSA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Calhoun-class was the last significant pre-war battleship design.  Limited by the Washington Naval treaty, total tonnage never pushed past 33,000 tons, making the Calhoun relatively smaller than its contemporaries.  However, efficient boilers and a strong armor belt gave the Calhoun better speed and armor than ships of similar size, at the cost of overall firepower."
 CSA_battleship_3:0 "Texas Class"
 CSA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Texas-class was introduced in war-time.  Freed from any restrictions regarding tonnage or weaponry, the CSN went light - outfitting the Texas with better boilers and fire control than heavier guns.  Part of this had to do with cost, as battleships were expensive for country like the CSA to build and maintain."
 CSA_battleship_4:0 "Nathaniel Green Class"
 CSA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Nathaniel Green-class battleships were a hypothetical design based on the Bismarck and the Union's Iowa class.  Valuing speed and anticipating the importance of missile technology, the Nathaniel Green-class possesses the same tonnage of the Texas, with general improvements to armor, fire control and protection, while placing significant emphasis on better engines."
 CSA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Thomas Jefferson Class"
 CSA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "One of the biggest ships of the pre-war era, only eclisped by ships like the IJN Yamato.  The Thomas Jefferson displaced 60,000 tons, and carried 420mm naval artillery as main guns.  While capable of tearing apart nearly any ship that could engage it, it drank oil and had difficulties in maintenance due to its large, unwieldy bulk."
 CSA_SH_battleship_2:0 "Dixie Class"
 CSA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Dixie-class battleship was a hypothetical design based on experiences from the Thomas Jefferson class.  Displacing nearly 70,000 tons, bristling with guns, and crewed by over 2000 sailors, it was meant to be a terror weapon.  No self-respecting small nation would challenge it, and no modern navy would ever engage it in a fair fight."
 CSA_carrier_1:0 "Alliance Class"
 CSA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Alliance-class was the first generation of main fleet carriers in the CSN.  Like the USA, the British and the Japanese, the Confederates had to convert several battleships into carriers, one of which was struck after being deemed mechanically compromised.  The only ship of its class, the Alliance, could be favorably compared to the Kaga and the Ark Royal.  The name 'alliance' was suggested to highlight cooperation with the League of Nation."
 CSA_carrier_2:0 "Bastion Class"
 CSA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Bastion-class was developed in 1935 as the possible replacement for the Alliance-class.  Possessing a larger flight deck and advanced AA, but still converted from battleship hulls, it was not much better than its contemporaries and was already absolete by the beginning of 1939.  Bastion was suggested as the CSA's position in world politics gradually became more defensive."
 CSA_carrier_3:0 "Confederacy Class"
 CSA_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Confederacy-class was the CSN's first dedicated aircraft carrier, taking hints from later Japanese and American carriers.  It displaced 35,000 tons, and could nominally carry up to 120 planes at a time.  Envisaged for warfare in the Mid-South Atlantic and potentially against Japan, it was built for space and hardiness - both of which the CSN could, and did, accomplish in its first design, the CSS Patriot."
 CSA_carrier_4:0 "Stonewall Class"
 CSA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Stonewall-class was the CSN's first stab at a 'supercarrier.'  As the war drew to a close, the CSN evaluated the importance of escort and mainline carriers and found that future conflicts would either require many small carriers or a fleet of 3-4 heavy carriers with an air base worth of aircraft each.  The design team chose the latter option.  Displacing 45,000 tons and armored almost as heavily as a battleship, Stonewall designs were touted as both powerful and completely unnecessary for policing a post-war world."
 CSA_destroyer_1:0 "E/F Class"
 CSA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The E/F classes of destoryer were built with British aid during and after the Great War.  The CSN's participation in the British navy's convoy effort had the unfortunate side effect of decimating the local fleet.  Post-war, the CSA ordered up to 30 destroyers based on British designs to replace their losses."
 CSA_destroyer_2:0 "G Class"
 CSA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G class excelled at the one thing it was designed for - production time.  Built under the Confederate charter of ships, G class destroyers were built with simple hulls, simple engines, and hard-to-tax engines and boilers.  While not flashy, they are rugged and capable of fighting hard and long in service of the main fleet.  As discovered during the Battle of the Atlantic, however, it lacked the space for advanced anti-sub weapons."
 CSA_destroyer_3:0 "Ironclad Class"
 CSA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Ironclad was a call-back to raiding vessels of the Civil War.  A floating headquarters, the Ironclads were large destroyers designed to lead destroyer formations and operate independently, much in the same vein as contemporate Mogador destroyers.  As escort leaders, they were often equipped with 4-6 depth charge launchers to make the most of escort fleet's capabilities.  On their own, their torpedo armament and repeating guns gave Ironclad destroyers enough firepower to take on light and even heavy cruisers."
 CSA_destroyer_4:0 "Mobile Class"
 CSA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Mobile class destroyers were the last wartime destroyer class produced for the CSN, and represent a coordinated response to all of the problems the G class presented.  Being easy to manufacture, difficult to kill and extensively modifiable, the Mobile was extensively produced during and after the war, mostly under contract.  Many examples are still in service today, under the banners of small oceangoing navies."
 CSA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Atlanta Class"
 CSA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Atlanta class cruiser was developed shortly after the Washington Naval Treaty was signed.  Displacing 2,000 tons and armed with torpedoes, it was designed as the pair for the aging Bull Run armored cruisers from the Great War, as a support cruiser.  The cruiser race in the later half of the 20's surprisingly did little to damage the Atlanta class's reputation as a sturdy, if onerous, ship to pilot."
 CSA_light_cruiser_2:0 "Charleston Class"
 CSA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Citing security concerns for the merchant marine from the growing Ethiopian crisis, the CSN courted the 2nd Congress to develop a light cruiser with more appropriate weight and armament to compare with Italian and French cruisers.  The poor Atlanta, despite being technically fine for its time, was phased out after a rushed production of the CSS Charleston.  Aside from displacing 3,000 tons, it also sported a stronger AA array and a better gunnery layout."
 CSA_light_cruiser_3:0 "Manassas Class"
 CSA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "At the outbreak of war, the CSN was seriously evaluating the current shape of the Confederate navy, and came to the conclusion that it would need a stronger array of light cruisers, meant to fill the role that heavy cruisers filled by upping their weight and gunnery.  The 'one cruiser' plan, meant to economize on the limited shipyard space of the CSA, because the 'three cruiser' plan when initial designs for the Manassas ran up against urgent needs for more destroyer escorts and for more sophisticated radar and fire control systems, which were difficult to fit on an already taxed design."
 CSA_light_cruiser_4:0 "Gettysburg Class"
 CSA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Gettysburgs were the last war-time cruisers built for the CSN, under the 'three cruiser' plan.  Design emphasis was placed on a tough keel, a suitably powerful engine, strong AA and the implementation of an inventory of spare parts and machinery meant to service any destroyer or light cruiser that needed it without extensive machine shop specialization.  The Gettysburg achieved that, while also managing to piss off the Union Navy by name alone."
 CSA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Arlington Class"
 CSA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Arlington class is a post-Washington, but pre-Depression-era armored cruiser designed to replace the need for heavy armament at sea, while retaining the design flexibility to pair them with light cruisers or destroyers.  The CSS Arlington at the time of its launch, 1928, it was roughly on par with Japanese designs of the day, and was relatively respected for its power-to-speed ratio."
 CSA_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Cold Harbor Class"
 CSA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Cold Harbor arrived at a time of insecurity for the Confederate navy.  As Axis nations tore up the Washington naval treaty, the implicit need for modern battleships and carriers took over the conversation for fleet building.  The Cold Harbor design, while good for its time, was overshadowed by design concerns for the Bastion-class Carrier.  Displacing 7,000 tons, it could hold its own against Union cruisers of its weight, but had mechanical engineering problems, stemming from a taxed boiler system designed for lighter cruiser designs."
 CSA_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Project M Class"
 CSA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Project M class represented the last consideration of heavy cruiser designs for the CVN.  With naval orders favoring convoy escort craft and aircraft carriers, the lack of implicit need for heavy cruisers ultimately doomed their viability.  Project M, the Mount Vernon, was a slight improvement on the Cold Harbor design, but by 1940, it lacked the comfort features of comtemporary Union and British cruisers, as well as the requisite speed to match German counterparts."
 CSA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Byrd Design"
 CSA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Byrd design was a hypothetical class of heavy cruiser designed for a less powerful Confederate navy.  The design was initially approved in 1938, but would've only gone into production in 1942 in Ingall's new upriver shipyards.  The Byrd design was meant to both upgun the heavy cruiser and make it able to navigate major rivers - as the Byrd administration feared a war with either the US or Britain and thought to design naval vessels that could be maintenanced upriver, away from the coast and potential enemy submarines."
 CSA_submarine_1:0 "S-Boat Class"
 CSA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The S-Boat class was a Great War design lifted off British-built subs.  Very few differences distinguish the two types of the craft, as the CSN's design teams were advised to stick as closely as possible to the British line."
 CSA_submarine_2:0 "S35 Class"
 CSA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The S35 class was a native design, taking after innovations in sub design from the Surcouf, Japanese large subs and the next generation of German submarines.  A high dive depth, 22knt propolsion and the implementation of new 'slipstream' torpedoes gave the S35 uboats unprecendented operational flexibility."
 CSA_submarine_3:0 "S39 Class"
 CSA_submarine_3_desc:0 "Contrary to popular belief, the S39's were only a minor improvement on the S35 design, taking lessons learned from convoy raiding in the Atlantic to its logical conclusions.  S39's incorporated more reliable balast tanks, streamlined hulls and greater dive times, achieved through mechanical simplications in engine and crew quarters design." 
 CSA_submarine_4:0 "S44 Class"
 CSA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The S44 class is the CSN's first attempt at a diesel-electric submarine, developed right at the same time as German attempts to produce the same.  The design was markedly successful, producing more than 200 S44 submarines before the close of the war."
 CSA_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Florida Class"
 CSA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Florida class was the CSN's attempt at circumventing the tonnage requirements of the Washington Naval Treaty.  Much like German battlecruisers of the period, the Floridas skirted the line of cruiser and battleship by being labeled as one but equipped with the rough tonnage and armament of the other, sitting at nearly 25,000 tons while being equipped with three-gun 360mm turrets."
 CSA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Caribbean Class"
 CSA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The CSN's lack of experience with raiding and interstitial armored craft made the Caribbean an awkward ship to design.  While sporting upgunned turrets and a heavier displacement, it was meant to adopt the same role as the German heavy cruisers and battlecruisers of its time, an expectation that it scarcely was able to live up to.  While still serviceable, it saw limited use in its namesake sea and in allied merchant raiding after its launch in 1941."
